          <p class="section-content">
            In the current gaming market, Easy Get Coin faces two main problems: data opacity and
            lack of ownership protection.
          </p>
          <ol class="section-content ordered-list">
            <li class="ordered-list-item">
              Data is not transparent:<br />
              Existing game platforms often adopt centralized data management, making it impossible
              for players to fully understand and verify events that occur in the game, such as item
              drop rates, transaction records, or other playersâ€™ behaviors. This opacity erodes
              playersâ€™ trust in the gaming system and can lead to questions about the fairness of
              the game.<br />
              The lack of transparency also affects transactions and interactions between players,
              as they cannot verify the credibility of the counterparty or the authenticity of the
              items being traded.
            </li>
            <li class="ordered-list-item">
              Lack of ownership protection:<br />
              In traditional game models, in-game assets (such as virtual items, characters, or
              currencies) purchased or earned by players are actually still subject to the control
              of the game company. This means that even if players invest significant time and
              resources, their control over these assets is limited. This model limits playersâ€™
              freedom to dispose of their in-game assets, including trading, transferring, or using
              them outside the game.<br />
              These problems not only limit the depth and breadth of player experience, but also
              hinder the development potential of the game industry. Therefore, Easy Get Coin is
              committed to solving these problems through blockchain technology and providing
              players with a more transparent, free and fair gaming environment.
